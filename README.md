# Tokamak Fusion Reactor Optimization

**Final Project, Computational Physics, Fall 2024**

This project uses reinforcement learning to optimize the position and plasma current within a tokamak, inspired by and based upon the research and findings of the TCV fusion experiments. 

Please refer to the **Useful Information** directory for resources. We are primarily referring to the [*Magnetic control of tokamak plasmas through deep reinforcement learning*](https://github.com/MrLou1976/PHY_329_Final_Project/blob/main/Useful%20Information/Magnetic%20control%20of%20tokamak%20plasmas%20through%20deep%20reinforcement%20learning.pdf) and [*Supplementary Information*](https://github.com/MrLou1976/PHY_329_Final_Project/blob/main/Useful%20Information/Supplementary%20Information.pdf) documents. Additionally, we will base our code on the files provided in **fusion_tcv**.
