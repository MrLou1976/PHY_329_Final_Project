# PHY_329_Final_Project

Tokamak Fusion Reactor Optimization

We will optimize the number of magnets that must be turned on to achieve a specific energy field within the tokamak for fusion reactors.


Please refer to the **Useful Information** directory for resources.

Within the **Useful Information**, we will primarily refer to the *Magnetic control of tokamak plasmas through deep reinforcement learning* and *Supplementary Information* documents.

Additionally, we will base our code on the files provided in **fusion_tcv**.
